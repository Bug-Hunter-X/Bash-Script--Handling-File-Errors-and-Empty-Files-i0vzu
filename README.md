This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: insufficient error handling when dealing with files. The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file line by line but fails if the file doesn't exist or is empty.  The solution, `bugSolution.sh`, demonstrates robust error handling and checks for empty files.
